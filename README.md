# Swagger Codegen Demo

TypeScript continues to grow in popularity, and provides the benefits of strongly typed variables within JavaScript apps, but rewriting your API data models on each UI app can be monotonous and time consuming. In this session, we'll walk through how to use Swagger Codegen to automatically generate TypeScript interfaces and entire API libraries that handle requests to .NET Web API endpoints.

## API - .NET Core Web API

This project was created using .NET Core 2.1.

When running the Web API project, Swagger UI is available at the root URL: `https://localhost:5001/`

## UI - Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
